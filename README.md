# Project 3: Spots

### Spots

Spots is an interactive social media web application that allows users to upload photos and alter bodies of text to create expressive portfolios or exhibitions of content, as well as like photos uploaded by other users. Spots is configured for mulitple different browsers and devices. As it stands now, the project is simply a foundation, but once the project is fully functional, it should allow for even greater user customization and personalization!

The project was created using HTML and CSS code, browser dev tools, as well as Figma, a third party dev tool software.

- Don't worry about cropping your images! Spots uses HTML and CSS code to automatically format user's images to a 1:1 aspect ration, as well as formatting the text on the page to keep profiles, looking sleek and clean! Here you can see that code in action, preventing text overflow and cropping and centering this image.

- See a picture uploaded by another user you really like? Let them know you loved it by liking the image using the interactive like buttons found on every image on a user's profile (other than the profile picture).
- Spots is usable on a variety of devices, including desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices, allowing you to share your pictures wherever you are using whatever you want! Below you can see how Spots appears for Tablet and Mobile devices.
